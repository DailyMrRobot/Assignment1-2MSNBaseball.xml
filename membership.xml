            <comments><![CDATA[The .247 avg doesn't do him justice.  He is more like a .300 player,
    but I think maybe more game time is needed.  For playing IF, he does a
    great job.  Really quick on the feet.  Hope he returns next year.  Go Mallards!]]></comments>

    busy going to the games to post about them.  Seriously though... I cannot
    wait for next season.  My team is already out of the running, so I wait.]]></comments>
